       "was to find out the specific cause of the drop in productivity so that I could propose effective solutions for improvement that may benefit other teams as well.    Selection    Recognizing that the issue at hand is more personal in nature rather than technical, and requires an in-depth understanding of how team members like James perceive the current situation, Storytelling was the selected tool.     Application and Approach    A survey form was created to initially grasp the team’s concerns. Instead of conducting an open forum with all team members present, I decided to have one-on-one informal talks with each member, including James, to encourage more open conversations and gather insights effectively.    After these discussions, it became apparent that the information gathered was still insufficient, and team members were hesitant to raise all their concerns. To address this, I scheduled a half day for de-stressing for the team members, allowing them to engage in conversations and connect with other team members. They were then encouraged to raise any concerns they noticed from another team member’s perspective without revealing names. This approach significantly increased the feedback received from the members, including James.      Insights and Approach    Through these conversations, I had an insightful discussion with James, the youngest member of the team. He shared his growing fear about potential infections in the company housing compound and the vague protocols set by the company. Furthermore, James mentioned that he was being treated unfairly by other residents due to his parent recently returning home from working overseas. Although he had not made contact with his parent yet, he was wrongfully maltreated in the housing compound, hindering his ability to focus on work. I promptly raised this issue with the housing compound management for appropriate action, with the outcome still pending.     Another notable insight was the spread of rumors about the company planning manpower reductions, causing team members like James to proactively search for other job opportunities during their working hours, thereby decreasing the time available to complete assigned work items. In response, the company conducted transparency sessions and provided guidelines to address these concerns, with the effectiveness of these actions still pending evaluation.    Approach    Moving forward, I plan to incorporate de-stressing time and encourage members like James to raise concerns from other team members’ perspectives from the outset of similar initiatives. Moreover, I aim to involve housemates of team members in the process to gain a holistic understanding of the challenges faced by the team.</div>"
