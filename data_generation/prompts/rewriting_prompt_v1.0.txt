Essay: 
Assignment: Mindmapping

Challenge

The challenge was to develop a three-view mechanism for my class this semester, it was

together with my team to find a solution to this problem, which was intended to transmit

three messages in an advertisement.

Selection

I chose the Mindmapping tool because that tool was taught to me in my class this semester

and it was very useful to apply it to this problem since Mindmapping gives you the

opportunity to be more organized in terms of your ideas and fundamentals that are

connected between yes. Also, it is important to say that this tool is developed throughout

the project, in the beginning, in the development and when we had everything clearer and

at the end to know the organization that should be carried out and the order.

Application

As I mentioned before, I applied this tool in my project due to the order that it takes, at the

time of making the prototype of the project, a mindmap was made about what materials

was going to be used, how it was going to work, all that brainstorming was useful organize

it in a mindmap to carry out the project. Also at the time of developing the poster, a

mindmap was made of how each section should be organized and what information each

one should carry, in this way the mindmap tool was applied and it was possible to have a

very striking poster.

Insight

The insight that I gained was very great, since in my other projects I had not used the

mindmapping tool because I did not consider it useful, but at the time of applying the design

thinking with the mindmapping tool and the knowledge acquired it was possible to carry

out the project and obtain a perfect grade, appropriate to what the problem presented

Approach

Now that I have discovered the benefit of using the mindmapping tool, I think that what I

would do differently would be to make the most striking mindmaps because some

contained too much information that it was difficult to synthesize what the problem of the

project asked me to do.
